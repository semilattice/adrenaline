Bash environment

The Nix derivation wraps each Bash program so that the environment variables
«ADRENALINEBIN» and «ADRENALINELIB» are available at runtime. They may be
used to refer to the bin and share/lib folders of the derivation, to invoke
programs and source libraries.

For example, to source the source file «lib/Foo.bash» at runtime, write:

    source "$ADRENALINELIB/Foo.bash"

When you write a new Bash program you may want to add it to the derivation so
that a wrapper is created for it.
